            Welcome to Machine Learning Basics through Baseball!<br>
            The goal of this website is to provide a series of tutorials using baseball analysis to teach you the basics and application of python, statistics, calculus and linear algebra in ML techniques.<br>
            <brt>
            Maybe you're coming from a mathematics background and are interested in ML applications beyond the typical handwriting/flower petal/home value classifications. Maybe you're coming from a baseball background and want to learn more about advanced sabermetric applications. Maybe you read Meg Rowley's piece about <a href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/31192/players-prefer-presentation-breaking-lind/">Adam Lind's chalk fart</a>, got deep into baseball prospectus and are now interested in both baseball and math. Regardless of how you got interested in the crossroads between machine learning and baseball, this series of tutorials should help you understand both!<br>
            <br>
            The content is currently set up as a series of jupyter notebooks to allow you to run and play around with the code as you read through the material.<br>
            Additionally, a vital aspect of data management is in the collection and 'cleaning' of your data of interest, so each chapter comes with a guide on how I did that for each of the tutorials. While this information is not necessary for you to learn the lessons, I include it here for the curious.<br>
            <br>
            
            If you have any feedback / questions / notice errors / etc., please do not hesitate to reach out - my goal is to make this overview fairly complete but totally accurate.

            <br>
            I hope you enjoy this material!<br>
